# An Analysis of New York City Bikeshare Data
Present data from CitiBike in New York City to investors to make an argument to introduce a bikeshare initiative in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Overview of the analysis
Following our trip to NYC, Kate and I realized that part of what made our trip so enjoyable was the access we had to CitiBikes, a bikeshare company in NYC. We are exploring introducing something similar in Des Moines and have an interested investor. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. We have included the following in our proposal:

- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Results
### Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

Looking at trip durations overall, we notice that a majority of trips last less than an hour. This holds true when analyzing the data based on gender and based on age (by birth year). There are more trips taken by individuals who identify as male than those who identify as female, and more trips taken by individuals who identify as female than those whose gender is unknown. As birth year increases (age of rider decreases) the average length of ride increases slightly.

### Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

Looking at the trip trends overall, we notice that weekdays appear to have a higher concentration of trips in the typical morning and afternoon commute hours, whereas weekends appear to have a more uniform distribution during the daylight hours. Male subscribers (individuals with memberships, rather than takers of one-off rides) make up a larger portion of the rides across all days of the week. The trends of trips by day and hour do not appear to differ based on gender, however - once again, we see that there are more male riders than female riders, and more female riders than gender-unknown riders.
